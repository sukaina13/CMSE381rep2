The data: The Freiwald Tsao Face View AM dataset

Can we classify the face identity seen by the subject using neuron activity?

Classification Task: Classification Goal: Predict which of the 25 face identities was seen based on neuron activity recorded during each trial. Data Representation: Each row in the dataset represents neural activity recorded during a trial. Features: Spiking activity (binary values of 0 or 1) over time. Label: Face identity (one of 25 individuals). Models to Try: Logistic Regression (baseline model) k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Support Vector Machines (SVM) Random Forests Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) / Deep Learning (if enough data is available)


 Dataset Description

The Freiwald Tsao Face Views AM dataset contains neural recordings from the anterior medial (AM) face patchâ€”a region of the macaque brain that becomes active when viewing faces.

 Data Overview
Neural Activity: Spike train data recorded at 1 ms resolution across 800 ms trials.
Stimuli: 25 unique face identities, each shown from 8 head orientations.
Purpose: Decode face identity and head orientation using neural activity.
ðŸ”– Key Columns
site_info.monkey: Monkey subject ID (e.g., "lupo")
site_info.region: Brain region ("am" = anterior medial face patch)
labels.stimID: Stimulus identifier (face image ID)
labels.person: Person ID (face identity label)
labels.orientation: Head orientation (e.g., "front")
labels.orient_person_combo: Combined identity + orientation label
ðŸ”¬ Neural Spike Data (802 columns)
time.1_2 to time.800_801: Binary indicators of neuron spike (1 = spike, 0 = no spike)
Each column represents a 1 ms time bin of activity for that trial.
 Prediction Task 2: Total Spike Count

Objective: Predict the total number of spikes across all neurons in a trial.
Input: Face identity + head orientation.
Goal: Understand how strongly each stimulus (person/orientation) activates the brain.
Insight: Some identities might consistently trigger stronger responsesâ€”could indicate recognition or salience.
